# TODO:
    1) Run simulations with 4 agents, 1m timesteps, 1 episode, without discretization where you store the the dataframe
        sensitive analysis; on this perform causal discovery: 10-20-50-100 bin discretization
    2) averaged mean for reward_action_values in the action selection process, decide if the action with lower score
        could be removed
