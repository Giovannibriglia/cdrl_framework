# TODO:
    - setup better discretization: based on dataframe
    - finish casual inference for RL setup --> quartili-based filter
    - evaluate results of the sensitive analysis #bins
        - try to extract markov blanket and the equivalence class
    - launch big simulations: causal iql vs iql benchmarl vs ippo benchmarl
    - try to use other environments: transport, sampling...
